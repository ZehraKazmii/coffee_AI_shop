# Coffee_AI_shp
<p>Welcome to the Coffee Shop Customer Service Chatbot repository! This project encompasses the code, tools, and guidelines for developing an AI-driven chatbot aimed at enriching customer interactions within a coffee shop app. By harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and RunPod's robust infrastructure, this chatbot seamlessly manages tasks like order-taking, addressing in-depth menu inquiries, and delivering tailored product recommendationsâ€”all integrated into a React Native mobile application.

## Project Goals

This project aims to develop an intelligent, agent-driven chatbot that can:

- Facilitate real-time customer interactions, including order placements.
- Offer detailed information about menu items, such as ingredients and allergen details, using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.
- Deliver customized product suggestions powered by a market basket analysis recommendation system.
- Streamline the order process to ensure accurate and well-structured order submissions.
- Safeguard interactions by filtering out irrelevant or harmful queries through a Guard Agent, maintaining a safe and meaningful experience.
